# TDD-Simple-Calculator

### We’ll build a calculator to do some basic arithmetic(Part 1). 

#### We’ll follow a TDD approach. The basic approach is

    RED: we will write ONE failing test
    GREEN: we will make sure our test (and all tests written so far) pass
    REFACTOR: if our code is untidy we will clean it up
    repeat all the steps until all the functionality we need has been built and tested
